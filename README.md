## üß™ Exercises Overview

### Exercise 1: List Directory Alphabetically
- Lists the content of a given directory in alphabetical order (non-recursive).
- Uses: `DirectoryUtils.listDirectoryWithContents(...)`

### Exercise 2: Tree-Like Directory Display
- Displays the directory contents recursively.
- Shows whether an item is a file (F) or directory (D).
- Displays the last modified date for each file/folder.

### Exercise 3: Export Directory Listing to .txt
- Instead of printing to console, the directory content is written to a `.txt` file.
- Uses: `DirectoryExporter.exportDirectoryToFile(...)`

### Exercise 4: Read .txt Files
- Reads any `.txt` file and prints its content line by line to the console.
- Uses: `FileReaderUtil.printFileContent(...)`

### Exercise 5: Serialize and Deserialize Directory Info
- Creates `DirectoryItem` objects representing each file/folder.
- Serializes a list of these objects to a `.ser` file.
- Can later deserialize and display the objects from the `.ser` file.
- Uses:
    - `DirectorySerializer.serializeDirectory(...)`
    - `DirectorySerializer.deserializeAndPrint(...)`
